Testing Debrief 

Test 1 - Terry 

Works out in the field. Doesn't trust TAL - hates getting out bid at the last minute by people online. Thinks TAL is a scam - RB is bidding up the prices. Likes to see his competitors to bid against them. (*** MORE INFORMATIVE BID HISTORY - explain what happened. *** ANTI Sniping time extensions will help)

Doesn't have great eyesight, but was trained to use TAL by the assistants in Edmonton and has remembered ever since. Finds it a bit easier to use the more familiar desktop layout than the mobile layout. Gets around OK even still and was able to place bids on lots, although after a few attempts - clicked the categories "..." icon button first.

Signboards - need to be more readable - bigger screens or something. 
*** Maybe load TAL into the my bids area if you've placed a bid so you can quickly check the status - 



Chat 1 - Woman with Microsoft Surface Tablet - bidding for friends

Thinks APP is harder to use than TAL. Need to investigate further. 
Wants it to vibrate/notify when bid status changes.


Chat 2 - Chris who's helping out with TAL

- Group Bidding - Make sure it's super clear that you are bidding on one of the lots (or however many you chose);
- Thinks we need to keep bidding buttons on the main screen so ppl can quickly bid on many lots in succession. 


Test 2 - Zax auto and recreation sales - zaxautosales@gmail.com
Interested in orange book as a market guide for prices!

*** Wants a quick bid button on the listing screen - too much back and forth if he's bidding on multiple (which he almost always is), could easily miss the lots he's watching when they're coming down to the wire. 

Bids online a lot of the time. Got the hang of it pretty quick but is definitely pretty saavy.
