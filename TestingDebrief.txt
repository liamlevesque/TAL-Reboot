Testing Debrief 

Test 1 - Terry 

Works out in the field. Doesn't trust TAL - hates getting out bid at the last minute by people online. Thinks TAL is a scam - RB is bidding up the prices. Likes to see his competitors to bid against them. 

Doesn't have great eyesight, but was trained to use TAL by the assistants in Edmonton and has remembered ever since. Finds it a bit easier to use the more familiar desktop layout than the mobile layout. Gets around OK even still and was able to place bids on lots, although after a few attempts - clicked the categories "..." icon button first.

Signboards - need to be more readable - bigger screens or something. 
*** Maybe load TAL into the my bids area if you've placed a bid so you can quickly check the status
